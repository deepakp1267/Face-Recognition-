# Face-Recognition-

Developed a face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning algorithms

Face Recognition project combines `face_recognition` and OpenCV for real-time face detection. The project enables easy installation and setup of required libraries, employing a `CascadeClassifier` to highlight detected faces in video streams. Utilizing pre-trained models and tools, it offers an intuitive interface to identify faces through green rectangles, enhancing security and user experiences. The project showcases efficient integration of computer vision and machine learning techniques, making it a versatile foundation for various face recognition applications."
